# Improving-Snake

##Intro for my portfolio

This was my final project for my software design class, where we added functionality to an open source version of the game Snake. It was a group project with me and 4 other team members.


## Vision Statement

The ideal of improving snake is to take the [original snake game](https://github.com/hexadeciman/Snake) and add several quality of life features to improve the game. Hexadeciman’s original snake game is very simple, only having the most essential parts required to have a working snake game, leaving a ton of room for improvements. The goal is to add the following features:
 
* Scoring System
  * Increased score and movement speed for longer snakes
* Pause Menu
  * Also has the following options: restart, menu, quit
* Multiplayer
  * Local versus
  * Versus AI
* Create AI for playing the game
* General Perfomance improvements

## Project Overview

### Project Abstraction
A Java base snake game that uses threads and Java Swing. The objective is to add features to the game that enhances it in a meaningful way. Many of the improvements are aimed to improve quality of life and enhance gameplay.
Project Relevance
This project allows for practice of project management, version control with Github and practice creating tests for methods. It also allows practice of AI development and connection and transfer of data. 
Conceptual Design
Add features such as a pause-menu, restart the game, close the game entirely, a scoring system which uses an algorithm that gives the player increasing increments of points each time the snake eats from the location marked in-game and stores them, a second  ai control snake and a multiplayer. Features that could be added but are not rather needed is customization of snake, improved background, ability to increase speed in which the game is played out in.

### Building:
Must at least have version 8 of Java SE Development Kit.
Works with NetBeans 8.2 
Make sure the program is within a project on NetBeans
In the Run menu of NetBeans, simply click "Build Project"
 
Running:
This program does not contain any test methods so "Test Project" will not run.
Knowledge of the Java programming language and it's libraries
Understanding of multi-threading programming concepts
Java SE Development Kit 8
NetBeans IDE 8.2 (or any other Java IDE)
 

## Persona for each group member 

### X’Zaiver: John Doe, office worker
 
John, age 39, is an office worker in Kansas City, Missouri. Having been with his company for several years. John has graduated from one of the top 500 schools but has no knowledge of computers outside of basic software used for work. John wishes to have a quick game to play during his break periods that can be rather fast to play with a bit of competition. John enjoys playing class games from his childhood. The improving snake product aligns with John enjoyment of a classic game that incorporates a competition. 

### Benjamin: Fred Johnson, electrical engineer

An avid gamer since the original release of Tetris, Fred loves the classics. While not necessarily falling into the tradition gamer stereotype, he enjoys old school games never the less. Being an electrical engineer in his mid 40s, the current obsession with games such as Minecraft and Fortnite confuses Bob, as he dislikes the fancy graphics and lack of difficulty. Fred’s ideal night consists of cracking open a beer and playing mods for the original DOOM; despite a love for classic games, he appreciates modifications and improvements to them that embrace the original idea of the game. Coming across this repo, Bob was interested by the idea of a modded version of snake: he grew sick of the original game after achieving all the high scores at his local barcarde. 

### Leo: Tom Jones, Highschool teacher

Tom, a 32 Computer Science teacher has been looking for teaching examples for his students. For the final project of his course everyone is to program a simple game. The example hes looking for has to have many different aspects of game design that he can show to his students. This modified version of snake would be very helpful to Tom as he would be able to pull many examples of Java game programming.

### Cole: Kate Smith, Gradeschool teacher

Kate is a casual gamer with a low-end machine available to her at work. She has never gotten too crazy into games, but loves to play quick and simple games on her phone when she can. She would like to play more games on her work computer while between classes and on breaks, but most games are unable to run on her 15 year old computer. She wants a game that is fast to open and get started with, and has some variety in gameplay to occupy a few months of free time. All of Kate’s wishes would align with the Improved Snake project, as she could play against a variety of AI opponents with varying difficulty. She would also benefit from having an optimized, classic game that could run on any computer she works on.

### Mahmood: Timmy, Child

Timmy is eight and just can't seem to beat his older brother's
high score in Snake. He has no other friends to play with, but he wishes he could practice for his brothr. Timmy would like to play Snake againsta CPU opponent. That way, he could slowly up the difficult to hone his skills. 

## Feature List

The current feature list is located in the [project board](https://github.com/3296Fall2020/Improving-Snake/projects/1) of the repo.
